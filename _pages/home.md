### Why:

Technical and non-technical barriers to effective collaboration often
hamper progress, especially when highly productive groups with diverse
expertise and computational backgrounds work on common problems.
Overcoming these barriers and learning from collective experience is
critical for ensuring successful outcomes.

### What:

This two-part workshop will be conducted in an idea/innovation labs
format with meeting facilitators.  The goal is to bring together
thought-leaders and practitioners in data-driven open science projects
with participants from areas emphasizing Astronomy, Earth Sciences,
Computational and Information Sciences, Mathematics, and
Cyberinfrastructure.

We've dubbed the two workshops "Lemon" and "Lemonade" labs.  During
the Lemon Lab (Spring 2019), we openly discussed challenges in inter-
and transdisciplinary collaborations and brainstorm ideas on improve
productivity and outcomes.  At the subsequent Lemonade Lab (Fall
2022), participants will prototype ideas and solutions identified
during the Lemon Lab workshop in a codefest/hackathon-style event â€”
turning "lemons" into thirst-quenching "lemonade."

More details of the workshops are available in the [NSF proposal
here](/documents/TRIPODS-X-MainProposal.pdf).

### Who, When & Where:

After a very long hiatus we finally have the dates and venue finalized
for the concluding activity of the Lemon Labs series. Keeping with the
tradition of organizing events at fun locations, our amazing
colleagues at UT Knoxville have managed to secure a popular venue and
accommodations near [Great Smoky
Mountains](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm) ([Park
Vista](https://www.parkvista.com/), Gatlinburg) during fall foliage.

**Dates:** 17-20 October 2022<br/>
**Location:** Park Vista Hotel, Gatlinburg, TN<br/>
**Closest Airport:** McGhee-Tyson Airport (TYS), Knoxville, TN

To refresh our collective memory the goal of the two workshops "Lemon"
and "Lemonade" labs (funded by NSF). During the Lemon Lab, we
discussed challenges in inter and transdisciplinary collaborations and
brainstormed ideas for improving productivity and outcomes (summarized
in our [PLoS
paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008879)).

Many of you have incorporated parts of what we discussed in the PLoS
paper into new collaborations, courses, and labs. For the Lemonade
Lab, participants will share some of their experiences and suggest
improvements to the initial recommendations. The key activity for
Lemonade lab is to reimagine the technical/computing/collaboration
components for the [knowledge
commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons) aspects for
your discipline/community and sketching/prototyping ideas and
solutions in a codefest/hackathon-style.

Our participants will include practioners that build/support
platforms/tools for Data Science workloads and we will form teams that
collectively work on focused topics of interest. We will hold
pre-workshop planning zoom sessions so we can make this event
productive for everyone. This event will not have a virtual component
(all in person) as we expect smaller teams to wander off to a
hike/walk and work where they feel comfortable.

Please RSVP your attendance using this
[form](https://forms.gle/S7D8xPXs5QZw5wPm8). NSF funds will support
the travel and lodging, we will send details on booking your travel in
two weeks.

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions/suggestions.
