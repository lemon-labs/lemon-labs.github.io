### Why:

Technical and non-technical barriers to effective collaboration often
hamper progress, especially when highly productive groups with diverse
expertise and computational backgrounds work on common problems.
Overcoming these barriers and learning from collective experience is
critical for ensuring successful outcomes.

### What:

This two-part workshop will be conducted in an idea/innovation labs
format with meeting facilitators.  The goal is to bring together
thought-leaders and practitioners in data-driven open science projects
with participants from areas emphasizing Astronomy, Earth Sciences,
Computational and Information Sciences, Mathematics, and
Cyberinfrastructure.

We've dubbed the two workshops "Lemon" and "Lemonade" labs.  During
the Lemon Lab (Spring 2019), we openly discussed challenges in inter-
and transdisciplinary collaborations and brainstorm ideas on improve
productivity and outcomes.  At the subsequent Lemonade Lab (Fall
2022), participants will prototype ideas and solutions identified
during the Lemon Lab workshop in a codefest/hackathon-style event â€”
turning "lemons" into thirst-quenching "lemonade."

More details of the workshops are available in the [NSF proposal
here](/documents/TRIPODS-X-MainProposal.pdf).

### Who, When & Where:

Oct 17-20, 2022, held at [Park Vista Hotel, Gatlinburg,
TN](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/gktpvdt-the-park-vista-gatlinburg/)
near the [Great Smoky Mountains National
Park](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm).  Participants are requested
to arrive on Oct 17 and may depart on Oct 20 morning.  To ensure the
best outcome, we are inviting a maximum of 25-30 participants for the
Lemonade Lab.

### Perks of the Lemonade Labs:

- Travel expenses will be covered by reimbursements from the award.
- Learn best practices from subject matter experts for sharing data,
  code, models and obtain access to large-scale computing systems
  (CPU/GPU) at no cost for your TRIPODS project.
- Learn how different disciplines are making effective use of "Big
  Data" tools like Apache Spark, Storm, Kafka etc. and ML platforms
  TensorFlow, MLflow etc.
- Learn techniques for sharing reproducible analyses with
  collaborators.
- Learn how to establish a Commons for sharing products from your
  research projects, teams and TRIPODS center.
- Enjoy the tranquil, historic environment of Biosphere2 as the
  events' backdrop, with a behind-the-scenes tour by one of its
  scientists.
- Be part of a welcoming community of collaborators with experience in
  developing data science based tools, technologies and
  community-adopted resources.
